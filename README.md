# Hello World - OOMOL Workflow Project

English | [中文](./README_zh-CN.md)

## What is this project?

This is a demonstration project for the OOMOL platform that showcases how to work with different types of data and media files. Think of it as a "Hello World" example that helps you understand what OOMOL can do.

## What does it do?

This project creates a simple workflow that:

1. **Downloads files from the internet** - It fetches a CSV data file and a markdown text file from online sources
2. **Processes the data** - It analyzes the downloaded files using Python scripts
3. **Creates visualizations** - It generates charts, images, videos, and audio files
4. **Shows the results** - It displays everything in an easy-to-understand format including:
   - Data tables
   - Interactive charts
   - Images
   - Videos
   - Audio files
   - Formatted text

## Who is this for?

- **Beginners** who want to understand how OOMOL works
- **Data enthusiasts** who want to see how to visualize information
- **Anyone curious** about automated data processing workflows

## What will you see when you run it?

When you run this workflow, you'll get:
- A 3D visualization of geological elevation data (like a mountain terrain map)
- Various preview windows showing different types of media
- A data table displaying the processed information
- Examples of how different file types can be handled automatically

## How to use it?

1. Open this project in the OOMOL platform
2. Click the "Run" button to start the workflow
3. Watch as it automatically downloads, processes, and displays the results
4. Explore the different preview windows to see various output formats

## Technical details (for developers)

This project uses:
- **Python** for data processing and visualization
- **CSV files** for data input
- **Markdown files** for text content
- **OOMOL platform** components for file handling and preview

The workflow demonstrates key OOMOL concepts like connecting different processing blocks, handling various file types, and creating multiple output formats from the same data source.
